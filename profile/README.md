## 00. Introduce
 : Students who are alone can sometimes feel lonely and depressed.<br>
&nbsp; Therefore, we decided to start the ``Children'' Project to bring some comfort to their hearts and add a little happiness to their daily lives.

&nbsp;   The project's name, <br>
&nbsp;   "Children," is a combination of the pronunciations of "I", which means "I" in English, and "Ài", which means "to love" in Chinese.<br>
&nbsp;   Through this, I would like to send a message to students: ``We love you and are by your side.''<br>
&nbsp;   Our aim is to use our skills to make our students feel a little less lonely and to convey to them a warm message of comfort and love.
